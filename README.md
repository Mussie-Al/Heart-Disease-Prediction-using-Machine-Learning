# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify the likelihood of heart disease in patients using supervised classification algorithms. The project evaluates three machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting), with a focus on recall as the key performance metric, ensuring that actual positive cases (patients with heart disease) are not missed.

# Objectives
•	To preprocess and analyze heart disease patient data.\
•	To build predictive models using classification techniques.\
•	To evaluate models primarily based on recall, and secondarily on accuracy and F1-score.\
•	To identify the best-performing model for early heart disease detection.\

# Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available heart disease dataset (from Kaggle) containing medical attributes such as:
•	Age
•	Sex
•	Chest Pain Type (cp)
•	Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
•	Cholesterol Level (chol)
•	Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
•	Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)
•	And more...

# Tools & Libraries
•	Python
•	Pandas, NumPy
•	Scikit-learn
•	Seaborn, Matplotlib
